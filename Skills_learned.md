   - **SQL**: For querying and managing databases.

## 2. **Mathematics and Statistics**
   - **Linear Algebra**: Important for understanding algorithms like PCA and neural networks.
   - **Calculus**: Used in optimization and machine learning models like gradient descent.
   - **Probability and Statistics**: Key for understanding data distributions, A/B testing, and predictive modeling.

## 3. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**
   - **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
   - **MS Excel**: For quick data analysis, pivot tables, and basic visualizations.

## 4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
   - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
   - **Tableau/Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards.

## 5. **Machine Learning**
   - **Scikit-learn & sklearn**: A Python library for building machine learning models.
   - **TensorFlow & Keras**: For deep learning and neural networks.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, confusion matrices, precision, recall, etc.

## 6. **Big Data Tools**
   - **Apache Hadoop**: A framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
   - **Apache Spark**: For fast, in-memory data processing.
   - **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB for handling large-scale unstructured data.

   - **Git**: For version control and collaboration in coding projects.
   - **GitHub**: To manage repositories, track changes, and collaborate with teams.

## 8. **Data Wrangling**
   - Cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a usable format.
   - Handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.

## 9. **Communication Skills**
   - Ability to explain complex data findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
   - Writing clear and concise documentation for data projects.

## 10. **Deployment and Cloud Technologies**
   - **GCP**: For deploying and scaling data science models in production.
   - **Flask & FastAPI**: For building and deploying data science models as web applications.

## 11. **Business Acumen**
