# What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It applies principles from statistics, computer science, and machine learning to understand and analyze complex data patterns and solve real-world problems.

## Key Components of Data Science

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathering raw data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, APIs, sensors, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with inconsistencies in data to prepare it for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

4. **Data Modeling**
   - Using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that make decisions or forecasts based on data.

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Communicating insights from data using visual tools such as graphs, charts, and dashboards.

6. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploying models into production environments and monitoring them for performance and accuracy.
